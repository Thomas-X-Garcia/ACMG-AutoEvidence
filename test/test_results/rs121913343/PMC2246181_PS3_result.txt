[Yes] The article discusses functional analysis of the A1708V variant, including its transcriptional transactivation activity and centrosome amplification. The results show that A1708V possesses reduced transcriptional transactivation activity in two independent cell lines and induces centrosome amplification, but causes no significant change in nuclear foci formation. This suggests that the variant has an impact on BRCA1 function, as evidenced by these functional studies.
