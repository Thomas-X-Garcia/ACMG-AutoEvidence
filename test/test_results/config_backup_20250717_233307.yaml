  Analyze the following article abstracts and full text (when available) to determine
  if they provide evidence for classifying the variant {variant} according to ACMG
  criteria.


  ACMG Criteria to evaluate (focus on functional and clinical evidence):


  PS3 (Functional Studies): Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies
  supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product

  - Look for: enzymatic assays, protein function tests, cellular localization studies,
  splicing assays

  - Evidence must show clear functional impact


  PS4 (Prevalence in affected individuals): The prevalence of the variant in affected
  individuals is significantly increased compared to controls

  - Look for: case-control studies, cohort studies showing enrichment in affected
  populations

  - Must have appropriate statistical analysis


  PM1 (Critical functional domain): Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical
  and well-established functional domain

  - Look for: descriptions of protein domains, structural studies, conservation analysis


  PP3 (Computational predictions): Multiple lines of computational evidence support
  a deleterious effect

  - Look for: mentions of prediction tools (SIFT, PolyPhen, CADD, etc.) and their
  results


  For each criterion, provide:

  1. Whether evidence supports this criterion (Yes/No/Insufficient)

  2. Brief explanation of the supporting evidence

  3. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
